            <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>

            <p>
            We have talked several times about why data storytelling is important, what are the impacts and feelings that a storyteller wants to raise. But we have not discussed how to achieve such a goal to make up stories using facts and figures. You might think that is coming from the creativity of each person, which might be true. But there are some rational steps that will help you on this.
            </p>

            <p>
            Data sample we are talking about today is Disappearing planet, created by Anna Flagg and hosted on propublica.org. This can be considered a practical guideline for the book data storytelling by Cole Nussbaumer

            <h2>üåÆ Story</h2>

            <p>
            When you go to the visualization, made as an interactive webpage, the first thing you notice is that it is very relaxed for your eyes. It is not crowded with any information that will lead to the reader's distraction. The first impression is not with extra cluttering and allows you to navigate by scrolling or clicking in each segment, mammals, reptiles, amphibians or birds.
            </p>

            <p>
            But don‚Äôt jump around, we are just checking what it offers. It is like if somebody visits your home, people can clearly identify where to walk and sit down to start the interaction with you. You care that your house is organized and not over-saturated. You wouldn‚Äôt want anybody in your house to feel congested. You want your visitor to feel comfortable.
            </p>

            <p>
            That‚Äôs how this visualization makes you feel in the first 5 seconds. Quoting Cole Nussbaumer from the book ‚Äústorytelling with data‚Äù she says that (quote mark) ‚Äú if we have used our pre attentive attributes wisely, even if we get that initial 3-8 seconds, we have given our audience the gist of what we want to say‚Äù
            </p>

            <p>
            While reading the first section, you feel engaged by the impact of non natural conditions also known as human impact on animal extinction. The text is very concrete and no further explanations or citations are required for the articles which the author uses as arguments.
            </p>

            <p>
            When finishing scrolling the interactive tortoise leads you to the next  section. All the below sections are more detailed information about each species. All these 3 sections have the same kind of visualization. First of all, you can notice that basically there are 2 colors. Gray scale and red. This gray or white color for visualization is highlighter for least concerned species of animals. The red symbolizes danger.  As you can see when you select a family in the barchart in particular, the red highlighted word. However, the horizontal scroll bar color is black which does not strain your eyes and keep them relaxed.

    <p>Therefore, using minimal color effects, interactive elements, and combination of speed and accuracy
    while interpreting the data draws attention of our audience that can make our data storytelling more
    effective.</p>
